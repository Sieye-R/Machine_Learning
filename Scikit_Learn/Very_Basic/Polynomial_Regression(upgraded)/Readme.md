The tasks in this folder are exactly the same as <a href="https://github.com/Sieye-R/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Scikit_Learn/Very_Basic/Polynomial%20Regression.ipynb">Polynomial Regression.ipynb</a>.

1. How to find a formula for the polynomial regression for n-th degree
2. How to plot the polynomial regression for n-th degree

I separated 'Polynomial Regression.ipynb' into two files. <a href="https://github.com/Sieye-R/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Scikit_Learn/Very_Basic/Polynomial_Regression(upgraded)/PolynomialRegressionTools.py">PolynomialRegressionTools.py</a> contains programming for the goals and the goals are visible in
<a href="https://github.com/Sieye-R/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Scikit_Learn/Very_Basic/Polynomial_Regression(upgraded)/Polynomial%20Regression%20(upgraded).ipynb">Polynomial Regression (upgraded).ipynb
</a> without scrolling. 

In 'Polynomial Regression.ipynb', I had a problem to use a decorator but in 'PolynomialRegressionTools.py' I used a decorator successfully.
